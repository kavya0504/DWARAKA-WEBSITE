    <h2>Dwarka: Myths & Legends</h2>
    <p>Dwarka, once called Anarta and Kusasthali, is believed to have been built by Lord Vishwakarma on the request of Lord Krishna. The golden city was submerged into the sea after Krishnaâ€™s departure. It was the capital of the Yadava dynasty, including Krishna, Balarama, and others.</p>

    <h2>Archaeological Discoveries</h2>
    <p>Marine excavations since 1963 have uncovered underwater walls, anchors, and artifacts. These findings suggest Dwarka was a thriving ancient port and possibly the same city mentioned in the Mahabharata.</p>

    <h2>Early Historical Mentions</h2>
    <p>Historical records mention King Vasudeva II, Rudradama, and Adi Shankaracharyaâ€™s connection to Dwarka. A math was established here and the temple renovated in 885 AD.</p>

    <h2>Medieval to Modern Era</h2>
    <p>Dwarka faced invasions in 1241, 1473, and 1551. Temples were damaged but later restored. In 1958, a golden temple pinnacle was added. Since 1960, the Indian government manages the temple site.</p>
